Since its original publication in 1936, Gone with the Wind—winner of the Pulitzer Prize and one of the bestselling novels of all time—has been heralded by readers everywhere as The Great American Novel. Nominated as one of America’s best-loved novels by PBS’s The Great American Read. Widely considered The Great American Novel, and often remembered for its epic film version, Gone with the Wind explores the depth of human passions with an intensity as bold as its setting in the red hills of Georgia. A superb piece of storytelling, it vividly depicts the drama of the Civil War and Reconstruction. This is the tale of Scarlett O’Hara, the spoiled, manipulative daughter of a wealthy plantation owner, who arrives at young womanhood just in time to see the Civil War forever change her way of life. A sweeping story of tangled passion and courage, in the pages of Gone with the Wind, Margaret Mitchell brings to life the unforgettable characters that have captured readers for over seventy years.","author_name":"Margaret Mitchell","isbn":"1451635621","user_name":"Daheekim","user_rating":"5","user_read_at":"","user_date_added":"Fri, 30 May 2025 15:45:07 -0700","user_date_created":"Fri, 30 May 2025 15:45:07 -0700","user_shelves":"","user_review":"","average_rating":"4.38","book_published":"1936","content":" <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34689759-gone-with-the-wind?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss\"><img alt=\"Gone With the Wind\" src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1635768733l/34689759._SY75_.jpg\" /></a><br/> author: Margaret Mitchell<br/> name: Daheekim<br/> average rating: 4.38<br/> book published: 1936<br/> rating: 5<br/> read at: <br/> date added: 2025/05/30<br/> shelves: <br/> review: <br/><br/> ","contentSnippet":"","isoDate":"2025-05-30T22:45:07.000Z"},{"title":"Life of Pi","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7613482621?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss","pubDate":"Fri, 30 May 2025 15:45:02 -0700","guid":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7613482621?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss","book_id":"4214","book_image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1631251689l/4214._SY75_.jpg","book_small_image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1631251689l/4214._SY75_.jpg","book_medium_image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1631251689l/4214._SX98_.jpg","book_large_image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1631251689l/4214._SY475_.jpg","book_description":"Life of Pi is a fantasy adventure novel by Yann Martel published in 2001.

At age five-and-a-half she's knocking off double-digit multiplication problems and blitz-reading Dickens. Even more remarkably, her classmates love her even though she's a super-nerd and the teacher's pet. But everything is not perfect in Matilda's world... For starters she has two of the most idiotic, self-centered parents who ever lived. Then there's the large, busty nightmare of a school principal, Miss (\"The\") Trunchbull, a former hammer-throwing champion who flings children at will, and is approximately as sympathetic as a bulldozer. Fortunately for Matilda, she has the inner resources to deal with such annoyances: astonishing intelligence, saintly patience, and an innate predilection for revenge. Roald Dahl was a spy, ace fighter-pilot, chocolate historian, and medical inventor. He was also the author of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Matilda, The BFG, and many more brilliant stories.

Ron scans the obituary pages of The Daily Prophet looking for familiar names. Dumbledore is absent from Hogwarts for long stretches of time, and the Order of the Phoenix has already suffered losses. And yet... As in all wars, life goes on. Sixth-year students learn to Apparate, and lose a few eyebrows in the process. The Weasley twins expand their business. Teenagers flirt and fight and fall in love. Classes are never straightforward, though Harry receives some extraordinary help from the mysterious Half-Blood Prince. So it's the home front that takes center stage in the multilayered sixth installment of the story of Harry Potter. Harry struggles to uncover the identity of the Half-Blood Prince, the past owner of a potions textbook he now possesses that is filled with ingenious, potentially deadly, spells. But Harry's life is suddenly changed forever when someone close to him is heinously murdered right before his eyes. With Dumbledore's guidance, he seeks out the full, complex story of the boy who became Lord Voldemort, and thereby attempts to find what may be his only vulnerability.","author_name":"J.K.

His influence is suddenly everywhere in the Wizarding world, and his former allies, the Death Eaters, are returning to his side in droves. In response, the Order of the Phoenix, which worked to stop him during his last rise to power, has reconvened. This time, all of the adults Harry trusts have joined in. And even though Harry is at the center of many of their plans - Voldemort is intent on killing him, after all - they want so badly to protect him that they are keeping him completely out of the loop. Problems are cropping up at Hogwarts, too, where government officials are meddling in just about everything. And just because Voldemort and the Death Eaters are threatening open warfare does not mean that fifth-year students get out of their exams. Meanwhile, Harry's powerful connection to Voldemort seems to be growing even stronger, as he realizes that he has direct access to the Dark Lord's mind. It's time for Harry and his friends to take drastic action, but the course they choose will have terrible unforeseen consequences. Truly dangerous times have arrived in the fifth Harry Potter novel, but it never loses the trademark fun, excitement, and wonder at the possibilities of magic.","author_name":"J.K.

Professor Dumbledore has given them clues about what they need to do to defeat the dark wizard, Lord Voldemort, once and for all, but it's up to them to figure out what these hints and suggestions really mean. Their cross-country odyssey has them searching desperately for the answers, while evading capture or death at every turn. At the same time, their friendship, fortitude, and sense of right and wrong are tested in ways they never could have imagined. The ultimate battle between good and evil that closes out this final chapter of the epic series takes place where Harry's Wizarding life began: at Hogwarts. The satisfying conclusion offers shocking last-minute twists, incredible acts of courage, powerful new forms of magic, and the resolution of many mysteries. Above all, this intense, cathartic book serves as a clear statement of the message at the heart of the Harry Potter series: that choice matters much more than destiny, and that love will always triumph over death. Series Information: Eleven-year-old Harry Potter is an orphan living with his cruel aunt and uncle when he makes a discovery that will change his life forever: he is a wizard. He is whisked away to the mystical Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to learn magical skills, from potions to spells to flying on broomsticks. But an evil power is rising, the same one that threatened to destroy the entire world when Harry was only a baby. As Harry learns the truth about his family, his childhood, and his mysterious lightning-bolt-shaped scar, he finds unforgettable friendship, a loving surrogate family, and the courage to face the darkest force ever to menace the wizarding world.

At the Quidditch World Cup, Voldemort's signature Dark Mark appears in the sky over the stadium, causing pandemonium. The lightning-bolt-shaped scar on Harry's forehead is sporadically causing him agonizing pain, and he is also hearing disturbing voices. Harry realizes that all this is the result of a strong connection between himself and the Dark Lord, one that is putting him in grave danger. Back at Hogwarts, the students are getting ready for the upcoming Triwizard Tournament. Witches and wizards from two other schools are coming to Hogwarts for the year to compete in a series of grueling contests. The tournament is open only to students age 17 and above, but when someone secretly enters Harry's name, he is forced to compete. How can a 14-year-old possibly pass tests that might be fatal to an advanced wizard? And with the threat of Lord Voldemort looming, will he be able to focus on the tournament at all? For Harry, his friends, and everyone in the Wizarding world, the stakes are about to become much higher.

But just as he’s packing his bags, Harry receives a warning from a strange impish creature who says that if Harry returns to Hogwarts, disaster will strike. And strike it does. For in Harry’s second year at Hogwarts, fresh torments and horrors arise, including an outrageously stuck-up new professor and a spirit who haunts the girls’ bathroom. But then the real trouble begins – someone is turning Hogwarts students to stone. Could it be Draco Malfoy, a more poisonous rival than ever? Could it possibly be Hagrid, whose mysterious past is finally told? Or could it be the one everyone at Hogwarts most suspects… Harry Potter himself!","author_name":"J.K.

The meager facts of his biography have been gleaned from a handful of legal documents. Yet Vermeer's extraordinary paintings of domestic life, with their subtle play of light and texture, have come to define the Dutch golden age. His portrait of the anonymous Girl with a Pearl Earring has exerted a particular fascination for centuries—and it is this magnetic painting that lies at the heart of Tracy Chevalier's second novel of the same title. Girl with a Pearl Earring centers on Vermeer's prosperous Delft household during the 1660s. When Griet, the novel's quietly perceptive heroine, is hired as a servant, turmoil follows. First, the 16-year-old narrator becomes increasingly intimate with her master. Then Vermeer employs her as his assistant—and ultimately has Griet sit for him as a model.","author_name":"Tracy Chevalier","isbn":"0452287022","user_name":"Daheekim","user_rating":"4","user_read_at":"","user_date_added":"Fri, 30 May 2025 15:43:10 -0700","user_date_created":"Fri, 30 May 2025 15:43:10 -0700","user_shelves":"","user_review":"","average_rating":"3.93","book_published":"1999","content":" <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2865.Girl_with_a_Pearl_Earring?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss\"><img alt=\"Girl with a Pearl Earring\" src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327197580l/2865._SY75_.jpg\" /></a><br/> author: Tracy Chevalier<br/> name: Daheekim<br/> average rating: 3.93<br/> book published: 1999<br/> rating: 4<br/> read at: <br/> date added: 2025/05/30<br/> shelves: <br/> review: <br/><br/> ","contentSnippet":"","isoDate":"2025-05-30T22:43:10.000Z"}]
