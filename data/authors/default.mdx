## Hi <Twemoji emoji="waving-hand" /> I'm Dahee Kim

A self-taught software engineer in Incheon, South Korea.
Iâ€™m passionate about every layer of the stack - from pixel-perfect frontend work to robust backend systems. 
I am increasingly intrigued by how AI turns human language into code recently.
I enjoy peeling back the layers of computing, studying everything from low-level mechanics to high-level frameworks. 
Right now Iâ€™m building the ThinkStorm Project while sharpening my skills in **Next.js**, **Nest.js**, **DevOps**, and **system design**.
This blog is my online workshop - a place to log what I learn, create, and occasionally break. 
Putting ideas into words helps me think more clearly, troubleshoot faster, and meet fellow inquisitive developers like you. ðŸ˜Š

Writing and noting things down is a great way for me to solidify my understanding of new concepts and technologies,
and I hope that my blog can be a helpful resource for others who are interested in web development and related technologies.
